# Oxford AI Model Adoption Tracker

This project is part of a research collaboration focused on understanding how AI modelsâ€”particularly large language models (LLMs)â€”are being adopted across sectors. It supports ongoing work with the Oxford AI Policy Group to track trends in foundation model deployment, usage, and governance.

## âœ¨ Project Overview

The system collects and analyzes publicly available data on:

- AI model usage across public and private institutions
- Industry trends in the deployment of LLMs
- Model capabilities, licensing status, and release formats
- Adoption timelines, vendor relationships, and transparency metrics

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- **Global scraping pipeline**: Gathers structured data from company websites, news, APIs, and research sources
- **Model registry schema**: Organizes information on each AI system (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA)
- **Categorization engine**: Tags use cases and sectors (e.g., finance, government, healthcare)
